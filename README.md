## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ com/moodifyx/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Main.java              # Application entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MoodSelectorUI.java    # Main GUI interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MoodRepository.java    # Manages mood-to-song mappings
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Song.java              # Song data model

## Architecture

- **Model-Repository Pattern**: `MoodRepository` manages the data layer for mood-song relationships
- **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation between UI (`MoodSelectorUI`), data (`Song`, `MoodRepository`), and audio logic (`SongPlayer`)
- **Event-Driven GUI**: Swing components with action listeners for user interactions

## Available Moods

- **Happy**: Upbeat and joyful tracks
- **Angry**: High-energy, intense music
- **Chill**: Relaxed and laid-back vibes
- **Moody**: Emotional and introspective songs
- **Mysterious**: Enigmatic and atmospheric tracks
